/******************************************
Treehouse FSJS Techdegree:
project 1 - A Random Quote Generator
******************************************/

/*
  The code below will generate a random quote selected from an object (named quotes) containing an array of various quotes by famous feminists.
  The randomly selected quote will display: 1. The quote itself and 2. The name of the person who stated the quote. For some quotes, there is
  additional information about the quote, namely in what context it was stated (value for 'citation') and in what year it was stated.

  This code has the following set-up:
      - Section 1: The object 'quotes' and the string-variable html are defined;
      - Section 2: The two functions (called getRandomQuote and printQuote) are defined;
      - Section 3: The values of the randomly selected quote (stored in the variable html) are printed to the web page using the ID 'quote-box'.

  If something is unclear in this code, please contact me.
